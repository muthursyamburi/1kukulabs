PingPong Game
-----------------
In the Pong game, there will two players represented by two paddles, each of them moves and up and down directions. 
The board is divided into two courts occupied by each player. 
When the game starts, one player will be the server and he does the serve.
The ball then starts moving to the other court.
If it hits the upper and lower sides of the courts, the ball reflects.
One player will be using up and down arrow keys to move his bat up and down respectively
The other player will be using 'W' and 'Z' keys to move his bat up and down respectively 
Each player tries to hit the ball by moving the paddle/bat up and down, and if the ball hits the paddle, it reflects back to the other player's court.
The speed of the ball reflecting back, depends on the location on the bat where it touches.
If it touches at sides of the bat, its in top speed. Towards the middle, speed gets reduced.
If the ball misses the bat, the ball is lost and the other player earns a point.
The serve switches after every 5 points.
The points are displayed on the scoreboard.
Whichever player reaches 21 points first will win. If both reaches 20, then who ever earns a difference of 2 points will be the winner
